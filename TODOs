Nothingmuch TODOs:

- Start work on the packed representation -> @nothingmuch
- Need some papers for better coinjoin classification. -> @nothingmuch

Armin TODOs:

- Finish id handled and import macros from sim
- Traits for abstract fingerprints
- Analysis pass over loose data should work over unordered collections.
- "better" uf datastructure.

Major features we already have:

- binary classification for coinjoin detection (for loose not packed)
- Hueristics analysis
- Analysis can outputs some underdermined results (marked explicitly) or just refuse to analyze until the full dataset is available.

Major features we need:

- Bounded parent tx look ups -> graph traversal (decendants/predecessors)
  - Due to sensativity of this type of analysis, due to the order of the txs to be analyzed (parent or child may not be available at the time of analysis). This need explicit dependency tracking. Some notion of dispatching re-analysis when neighboring txs are available.
- Arb value classification -> subset sum analysis
- Graph laplacian
  - bounded depth exact
  - Isvans approximation
- Packed representation of everything
- Probabilistic clustering notion of uncertainties.
